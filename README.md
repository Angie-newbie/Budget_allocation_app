## Overview
 ###The Budget Allocation App is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help users optimize their monthly income through tailored budgeting and expense planning. The app calculates how users can best allocate their income across various expense categories.


## Features
    **User Input**: Collects monthly income and fixed expenses from the user.
    **Budget Allocation**: Calculates the budget for various categories like Savings, Investments, Dining Out, and Guilt-Free Spending.
    **Budget Visualization**: Displays a pie chart representing the budget breakdown.

    Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:
        - **Python 3.x** (Recommended: Python 3.8+)
        The following Python libraries (can be installed using 'pip'):
            - 'matplotlib': For visualizing the budget allocation in a pie chart.
